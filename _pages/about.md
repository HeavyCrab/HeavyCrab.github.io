I am a first‑year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at Washington University in St. Louis. I earned my B.Sc. through the Turing Class program at Peking University and subsequently completed my M.S. at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University. I continue to work under the supervision of my master’s advisor, Professor Chongjie Zhang, and my current research focuses on Multi‑Agent Reinforcement Learning.

I have a wide range of passions in the arts—enjoying films, anime, classical music, poetry, novels, and calligraphy. Outside of academia, I often play badminton for exercise, and I simply cannot live without sweet foods.
