I am a first‑year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from Turing Class, Peking University and subsequently completed my M.S. at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University. I continue to work under the supervision of my master’s advisor, Prof. [Chongjie Zhang](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html), and my current research focuses on Multi‑Agent Reinforcement Learning.

I have a wide range of passions in the arts—enjoying films, anime, classical music, poetry, novels, and calligraphy. Outside of academia, I often play badminton for exercise, and I simply cannot live without sweet foods.
